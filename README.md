## About The Project

Unlike other LLMs, AEXP-base-v0.1, which you can train on your own data, offers you a personal artificial intelligence experience!

Here's why:
* You can ask your questions!
* You can chat!
* And most importantly, you can train a chatbot from scratch with your personal database! :smile:

This automation was done only to create the dataset of the natural language processing (NLP) model. Thanks to this automation, you can contribute to the dataset of the AEXP-base-v0.1 NLP model.
