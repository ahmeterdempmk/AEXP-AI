<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Unlike other LLMs, AEXP AI, which you can train on your own data, offers you a personal artificial intelligence experience!

Here's why:
* You can chat and joke with him!
* You can teach him something new!
* And most importantly, you can train a chatbot from scratch with your personal database! :smile:

Of course, this project is not exactly a chatbot now, this automation was done only to create the dataset of the natural language processing model. Thanks to this automation, you can contribute to the dataset of the aexpai natural language processing model.
